            "objective": "I need help with research on whatconverts because I need to set up conversion tracking for a new client, and I've never used whatconverts before. The goal of the research is to give me a clear, detailed step-by-step plan to follow in order to set up whatconverts tracking. I have a Google Ads campaign which is driving traffic to a landing page on that page of forms built in Unbounce. On those forms are phone numbers, so I will need to set up call tracking and form tracking. The Markdown files in the project are simply URLs to some of the pages in WhatConverts that I have looked over. I am a little bit confused, so that is why I am going down this route. Please stop me at any point to ask me questions so that we can get something that will actually help me.",
