            "objective": "I need help with research on whatconverts because I need to set up conversion tracking for a new client, and I've never used whatconverts before. The goal of the research is to give me a clear, detailed step-by-step plan to follow in order to set up whatconverts tracking. I have a Google Ads campaign which is driving traffic to a landing page on that page of forms built in Unbounce. On those forms are phone numbers, so I will need to set up call tracking and form tracking. The Markdown files in the project are simply URLs to some of the pages in WhatConverts that I have looked over. I am a little bit confused, so that is why I am going down this route. Please stop me at any point to ask me questions so that we can get something that will actually help me. We have made some progress but now I REALLY need help with setting up call tracking",
