## 1. Keyword Level Tracking using Dynamic Number Pools & DNI

### Overview

Utilizing Dynamic Number Pools gives you the most comprehensive data of all the call tracking options; inbound call details will include the source and medium along with all the marketing data you'll need to make great marketing decisions.

DNI ([Dynamic Number Insertion](https://www.whatconverts.com/features/lead-tracking/call-tracking/dynamic-phone-number-insertion/)) is the technology we use to automatically swap the telephone number displayed on a website with a tracking number.

### Benefits of Dynamic Number Pools

Using Dynamic Number Pools opens up user-based tracking. User data is captured and recorded with each incoming lead, including:

- The page the user has landed on
- The page they are on when they call
- Marketing data associated with their visit
- Other user-based data (IP Address, Browser, Device and Operating System information)

### Complete Marketing Picture

By using a dynamic number pool, you get the full marketing picture of your incoming calls including:

- **Source**
- **Medium**
- **Campaign**
- **Content**
- **Keyword**
- **Lead Page**
- **Landing Page**
- **User-based data** (IP Address, Browser, Operating System and Device)

### Additional Features

In addition to seeing this data and reporting it in your WhatConverts dashboard, using Dynamic Number Pools also allows you to send conversions based on those calls back to Google Ads and Bing Ads; something that isn't available with other types of call tracking.

## 2. Offline Call Tracking

### Overview

This method allows you to receive a tracking number for each offline marketing method you want to track. Examples include:

- Flyers
- Magazine ads
- Google My Business page
- Other social media profile pages

### How It Works

Each time someone calls your offline tracking number, the call is forwarded to your destination number or call flow. This gives us the ability to report caller information such as:

- Caller ID
- State
- Call duration
- Call recording (if enabled)
- Call transcription (if enabled)

### Setup Information

## 3. Marketing Source Call Tracking with DNI

### Overview

This method allows you to assign a tracking number to each individual marketing source you want to track.

### Example Use Case

If you are interested in tracking how many calls are generated from Google organic search, you would buy a tracking number and then simply choose the number to be triggered to swap out on your website every time a visitor arrives from Google organic search results.

WhatConverts will report all calls from each marketing source, complete with lead details and even call recordings.

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros
- You only need 1 tracking number per marketing source you want to track

#### Cons
- No keyword or campaign information
- Only tracks marketing sources you specifically setup a number for
- You won't be able to pass conversions back to Google and/or Bing Ads
