# Call Tracking - WhatConverts

## Overview

Call tracking in WhatConverts allows you to capture phone call leads and tie them directly to the marketing source that drove the call—including the ad, keyword, campaign, or webpage that brought each customer to your site.

With call tracking in place, you can:

- Attribute phone leads to specific marketing efforts
- See which sources generate the most valuable calls
- Listen to recordings, apply lead qualification, and analyze call trends
- Combine call data with other lead types like forms, chats, and e-commerce for full-funnel visibility

This section will walk you through how to set up, customize, and troubleshoot your call tracking configuration. Whether you're using static numbers, dynamic number pools, or features like greeting/whisper messages, you'll find everything you need to get started below.
