# Form Tracking - WhatConverts

## Overview

WhatConvert's [Web Form tracking](https://www.whatconverts.com/features/lead-tracking/form-tracking/) allows you to immediately track and follow-up with Leads that contact you through Web Forms on your website. Each time a customer fills out a form on your website, WhatConverts captures the contents of that form along with the marketing source and instantly updates your [WhatConverts dashboard](https://app.whatconverts.com/) with the new Lead information.

This series of articles will assist you with initial set up and troubleshooting.
